===================================================
Date: Real WhatsApp conversation

11/13/2025:

CUSTOMER:
10:37 PM - "Aoa is there a slot available between 7-9 tommorow Friday"

AGENT:
11:20 PM - "No I'm sorry were completely booked but we do have a slot open from 8 to 9:30"

11/18/2025:

CUSTOMER:
4:44 PM - "Hi is there a slot available Wednesday anytime between 6-9"

AGENT:
4:55 PM - "Let us check the availability and get back to you."

KEY LEARNINGS:
- When slot unavailable, agent apologizes politely
- Agent offers closest alternative (8-9:30 instead of 7-9)
- Sometimes agent needs to check and respond later
- "Let us check" creates expectation of follow-up
- Customer uses flexible time range ("anytime between 6-9")
- Delay in response is acceptable (45 minutes in second case)
