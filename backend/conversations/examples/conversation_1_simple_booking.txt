CONVERSATION 1: Simple Booking Request
==========================================
Date: Real WhatsApp conversation example

CUSTOMER (Green bubbles):
4:57 PM - "Hi is there a slot available tomorrow Wednesday between 6-9"

AGENT (Grey bubbles):
5:08 PM - "Yes"
5:08 PM - "Available"

CUSTOMER:
5:15 PM - "I would like to book 6:30-8"

AGENT:
7:55 PM - "I would like to book 6:30-8"
7:55 PM - "Padel Futsal Cricket ?"

CUSTOMER:
7:55 PM - "?"
7:55 PM - "Padel"

AGENT:
7:57 PM - "8 own words are available" (likely OCR error: "8 slots are available")

CUSTOMER:
8:00 PM - "Ok and how much are the charges and is there any discounts on cards etc?"

KEY LEARNINGS:
- Customer provides date + time range in first message
- Agent confirms availability quickly ("Yes", "Available")
- Service type clarification needed (Padel/Futsal/Cricket)
- Price inquiry comes after slot confirmation
- Discount/card inquiries are common
- OCR errors possible in agent responses (need to fix)
