CUSTOMER:
11:28 PM - "Hi do u have a slot available tomorrow Friday between 7-9"

11/18/2025:

AGENT:
8:03 PM - "Rs7500/per hour 20 % discount after discount Rs6000/per hour\nCard discount is not available"

KEY LEARNINGS:
- Customer asks about specific time ranges ("between 7-9")
- Agent offers alternative times if exact slot unavailable
- Customer uses "?" to prompt response after delay
- Pricing structured: Base price → Discount → Final price
- Card discounts are common inquiry
- Agent clarifies what discounts are/aren't available
- Multi-day conversations need context preservation
- Typos common ("alot" = "slot") - NLU must handle this
