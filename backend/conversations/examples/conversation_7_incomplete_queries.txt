CONVERSATION 7: Incomplete Queries - Real Common Cases
=======================================================
Based on user feedback: Most people start with simple, incomplete messages

COMMON PATTERN 1: Just Greeting
Customer: "Salam"
Customer: "Hi"
Customer: "Aoa"

Agent Should:
- Match greeting style ("Salam" → "Salam", "Hi" → "Hi", "Aoa" → "AoA")
- Introduce service
- Ask what they want

Agent Response:
"AoA! Welcome to BookForMe. I can help you book padel, futsal, cricket, or salon. What would you like to book?"

COMMON PATTERN 2: Incomplete Availability Query (NO DATE/TIME)
Customer: "Koi slot hei?"
Customer: "Slot available hai?"
Customer: "Any slot?"

Agent Should:
- Recognize availability_inquiry intent
- Ask for missing information (date, time, service)
- Guide customer to provide details

Agent Response:
"Han g! Slots available hain. Kaunsa service chahiye? Aur kab ka time?"
(Yes! Slots are available. Which service do you need? And what time?)

Or in English:
"Yes, slots are available! Which service would you like? And what date/time?"

COMMON PATTERN 3: Vague Date, No Time
Customer: "Kal slot chahiye"
Customer: "Tomorrow slot available?"
Customer: "Aaj ka slot hai?"

Agent Should:
- Extract date: "kal" = tomorrow, "aaj" = today
- Missing: time, service
- Ask for time and confirm service

Agent Response:
"Han g, kal slots available hain. Kaunsa time chahiye? Morning, evening, ya night?"
(Yes, tomorrow slots are available. What time do you need? Morning, evening, or night?)

COMMON PATTERN 4: Vague Time, No Date
Customer: "Evening ka slot hai?"
Customer: "Shaam ka time hai?"
Customer: "Night slot available?"

Agent Should:
- Extract time: "evening" = 6-9 PM, "shaam" = evening, "night" = 9 PM-12 AM
- Missing: date, service
- Ask for date and confirm service

Agent Response:
"Han g, evening slots available hain. Kaunsa din chahiye? Aaj, kal, ya kisi aur din?"
(Yes, evening slots are available. Which day do you need? Today, tomorrow, or another day?)

COMMON PATTERN 5: Service Mentioned, Nothing Else
Customer: "Padel slot hai?"
Customer: "Futsal available?"
Customer: "Cricket ka time hai?"

Agent Should:
- Extract service: padel, futsal, cricket
- Missing: date, time
- Ask for date and time

Agent Response:
"Han g, padel slots available hain. Kaunsa date aur time chahiye?"
(Yes, padel slots are available. What date and time do you need?)

KEY LEARNINGS:
- Most customers start with incomplete information
- Agent must ask for missing pieces proactively
- Use natural conversation flow (not robotic questionnaire)
- Match language style (Roman Urdu queries get Roman Urdu responses)
- Guide customer step by step without overwhelming

NECESSARY HANDLING:
- "koi slot hei?" → Ask: service? date? time?
- "kal slot" → Ask: time? service?
- "evening slot" → Ask: date? service?
- Just greeting → Show services, ask what they want
