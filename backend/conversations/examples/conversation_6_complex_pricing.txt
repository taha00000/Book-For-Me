4:14 PM - "8-930 will be 5250"

AGENT:
4:14 PM - "8-930 will be 5250"
4:14 PM - "Yes"

KEY LEARNINGS:
- Pricing based on time-of-day blocks (not simple hourly rate)
- Time blocks: 03AM-11AM (Rs 2000), 11AM-7PM (Rs 2500), 7PM-03AM (Rs 3500)
- 8-9:30 PM slot spans two blocks (7PM-03AM block = Rs 3500/hour)
- Calculation: 1.5 hours × Rs 3500 = Rs 5250
- Customer calculates price themselves and confirms
- Agent confirms customer's calculation
- Pricing logic is complex (time-based blocks, not linear)
- System must handle time-of-day based pricing
- Customer asks clarifying question before committing
